        <P>The ferret (Mustela putorius furo) is the <br> domesticated form of the European polecat, a mammal<br> belonging to the same genus as the<br> weasel, Mustela of the family Mustelidae.[1] They<br> typically have brown, black, white, or mixed fur. <br> They have an average length of 51 cm (20 in) including a 13 cm (5.1 in) tail,<br> weigh about 1.5–4 pounds (0.7–2 kg), and have a natural lifespan of 7 to 10 years. <br> Ferrets are sexually dimorphic predators with males being <br> substantially larger than females.</P>
